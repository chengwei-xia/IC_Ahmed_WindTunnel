Wind Tunnel Experiment Docs (Imperial College London) - Ahmed Body Drag Reduction via Reinforcement Learning
=============================================================================================================

This is the laboratory document of the wind tunnel experiment on Reinforcement Learning flow control for drag reduction of an Ahmed body. This experiment is developed on the basis of the research of Brackston et al. 2016 (see ref) and the same Ahmed body model is used. 

This document records details of implementing data acquisition and Reinforcement Learning algorithm (see section "Software Setup"), cabling of sensors and installation of Ahmed body (see section "Hardware Setup"), and the procedure of running the experiment properly (see section "Experiment Manual").

.. note::
